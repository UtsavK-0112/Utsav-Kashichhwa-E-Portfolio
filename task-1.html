            <h3>Introduction to the World Wide Web (WWW)</h3>
            <h4>What is the WWW?</h4>
            <p>The World Wide Web (WWW) is an information retrieval system accessed through the internet. It consists of documents and web pages that are connected to each other via hypertext, and are retrieved and viewed using a web browser. </p>
            <h4>The role of web servers</h4>
            <p>A webserver is both hardware and software that stores and shares information. On the hardware side, a webserver is a computer that is always connected to the internet and supports physical data exchange with other computers connected to the web. It stores the web server's software, and files related to the website such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files. A web server software controls how a user accesses the hosted files. This is usually a HTTP server at a minimum.</p>
            <h4>What are web browsers?</h4>
            <p>A webbrowser is a software that retrieves information from the internet and displays it to the user. The information is transferred using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), and uses a software called a rendering engine to convert the data (written in HTML) into text and images. Web standards ensure that content on the web is formatted and functions the same on different browsers.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>How is the world wide web different from the internet?</h3>
            <p>The World Wide Web and the Internet are often used interchangeably, however they are not the same. The Internet is a global network of networks that allows a computer to connect to any other computer anywhere in the world, while the WWW is a collection of information which is accessed using the internet. Essentially, the internet is the infrastructure, and the WWW is a service that uses the infracture. The Internet was invented sometime in the late 1960s, and the web was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Internet Protocols</h3>
            <h4>What is IP?</h4>
            <p>An Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol for sending and addressing data so they can arrive at the correct destination. Data on the internet is sent in smaller chunks called "packets", and have IP information attached to them. This helps routers send the packets to the right place. Every device connected to the internet is assigned an IP address, which packets can be directed to.</p>
            <p>HTTP, TCP/IP and FTP are all protocols used to transfer information.</p>
            <h4>TCP/IP</h4>
            <p>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a transport protocol used with IP to deliver packets of data. Its functionality includes packet ordering, error checking, and re-transmitting the data if it is not received in the proper format.</p>
            <h4>FTP</h4>
            <p>FTP (File Transfer Protocol) uses the services of TCP to copy a file from one host to another. FTP is used when two hosts with different configurations such as different file name conventions, different directory structures, or different ways to represent data. </p>
            <h4>HTTP</h4>
            <p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used to exchange files on the world wide web, and like FTF, runs on top of the TCP protocol. It is used to transfer documents like HTML files. It works by clients and servers exchanging individual messages (called requests and responses).</p>
